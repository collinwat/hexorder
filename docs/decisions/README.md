# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) — lightweight records of significant
architectural decisions made in the Hexorder project.

## Format

Each ADR follows the template in `template.md`:

- **Context**: Why the decision was needed
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: What follows from the decision

## Naming

Files are named `NNN-title.md` where `NNN` is a zero-padded sequence number and `title` is a
lowercase-hyphenated summary. Example: `001-event-driven-communication.md`.

## Status Values
